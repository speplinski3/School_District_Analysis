# School District Analysis

## Overview & Purpose of Analysis

Our client, Maria, was notified of evidence indicating academic dishonesty in the reading and math grades for Thomas High School 9th Graders. The purpose of this analysis is to reassess previously given school district data without the Thomas High School 9th Grade reading and math scores. This will maintain the integrity of the data and read more accurately.
